<p> I have a sickening obsession with pugs, they are my favorite breed of dog and I would have 100 of them if I could.
I love their smooshed in faces and their pig noises. The loud snoring and the horrible gas is all part of the package and
you have to love all good and bad with the dogs.</p>

<h1> Gym and Sun </h1>
<p> I am a gym enthusiast and was a pretty frequent visitor to my local YMCA prior to the shutdown of 2020. I have recently 
began going back to the gym and getting myself back in shape. I enjoy some weight lifting with a lot of cardio. The treadmills
at my new gym almost have me saved as a perferred user. I enjoy going to the pool during the summers and hot tubs at night.</p>

<h1> Traveling </h1>
<p> I am considered a gypsy to most of my family in the sense that I cannot stay in the same place for too long before I get ancy. 
I have lived in over 19 states over the last 15 years and I am always looking to go to the next state. I love going to a new place
and taking in the culture and sites. When I'm not moving, I spend vacations between Hawaii, Mississippi and Florida. </p>
