<h1> Community College </h1>
<h2> Holmes Community College </h2>
<p> I began my college studies at the community college level. I began at this level because I did not take the traditional pathway directly
into college. I began college at age 28, all the while I was working a full time job and managing family responsibilites. I took the General
studies coursework with the intention to transfer into the university level. When I transfered to university, I had a 3.95 GPA and stuided 
mainly mathematics.</p>

<h1> Bachelor/ Master Degree </h1>
<h2> Arizona State University </h2>
<p> I began at ASU in the Fall of 2016. I originally began in the Electrical Engineering pathway and studied all mathematics in that pathway. 
I completed all 4 levels of Calculus, Modern Differential Equations and Applied Linear Algebra. I decided that was not the right field for me and 
transferred into the Information Technology program. My GPA has never fallen below 3.75 and will be higher before graduation. I was recently 
accepted into the 4+1 program and will graduate with my Bachelor's in Spring 22' and will have my Master's in Fall 22'. My major is Information
Technology with a minor in Mathematics. My Master's focus is on cloud based computing.</p>
